title: About

I am a marketer, turned software engineer, turned entrepreneur. Since 2011 I've been building communities, brands and websites on the internet. Throughout the years I've worked for big multinational companies, as well as startups in London, Berlin and Amsterdam. I am now building the brand and e-commerce platform for [DULO](https://weardulo.com) - a direct to consumer apparel company where we sell performance dress shirts.

In addition, I work as a freelance Shopify expert (setup, development, migration) and a marketing consultant. [Let me know](mailto:marin@weardulo.com) if I can help you bring your product direct to consumer.

Occasionally, I teach coding and digital marketing at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences.

<!-- I am always curious to learn new things and improve. I geek out on topics around productivity, personal development, bio- and life-hacking, fitness, but also movies and the entertainment industry. I believe that one can make the biggest impact in the world through [storytelling](https://soulstone.co). -->

If you want to stay in the loop you can [subscribe](http://eepurl.com/gwMX9n) to my list and I will occasionally send you emails.
