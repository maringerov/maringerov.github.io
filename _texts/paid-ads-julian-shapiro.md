#Prospecting
- Run time-based ads (in specific time windows, not all the time)
- Share pixels with other brands - target their audience
- Roll out ads one city at a time (higher frequency in a certain region) creates the image that you are big (geo-rollout). People think you are the biggest in the world - good for earning social proof (tactic to give the impression you are bigger than you are)

#LinkedIn Ads
- LinkedIn-first retargeting: narrow down individual criteria that map to ideal customer (get the cheapest clicks, through text ads + clickbait - all I want is the click (add should be with a picture of a man or woman, very zoomed in)) - drive traffic to the ads, once run ads, pixel them with facebook, then convert (target) through facebook ads

#Retargeting
- Use FB + IG as a main means
- Pair with something off of IG/FB
- First 4 days are the highest conversion rates when Retargeting
- You want to be everywhere - you start on FB/IG and you complement with CRITEO (use just for retargeting) (banner ads)
- LinkedIn retargeting ads (only if you do B2B)
- 4 day window - blast your budget then the highest (after day 5 they will see your ad at a high frequency and will report frequency) - Don't annoy people.
- For B2B: FB/IG - okay to run b2b ads (tailor to platform context - mimic IG filter)
- B2B: when doing cold outreach - do account based marketing- whitelist companies names and put in LinkedIn ads and target them - likelier to get a cold email response when you email later once they have seen your ad
- Ad-side and LP-side need to be different at different stages aka Prospecting vs Retargeting

Optimizing retargeting
- In the first 4 days - be broad - remind them you exist
- 5-30 - introduce time limited pressure (offer)
- Optimize for people visiting the site

#Attribution
- Ask people where they heard from you before they bought
- Zoned regions

#Videos - testing positioning
- Animoto - create a cheap video to test different style to position the Videos
- testimonial style Videos
- how it works video
- animated explainer video (not so good)
- b2b - screen recording video
- teaser video (5-10 sec) like stop motion - display what the product is (box - opens - product - value prop - offer - simple)

#Product vs Lifestyle - test product positioning
- test photos and videos
- focus on the product itself product focussed 0 only product
- lifestyle photo - how the product is used
- Start with product close up and end with a lifestyle photo when targeting men

#Comparison or Competitor ad + combined with a landing page for comparison
- kills it
- people understand what you are compared to a well known competitor - you don't have to explain what and who you are
- David and Goliath context
- people root for the underdog

#Copy
- Long ad copy and long form landing page - outperforms the short form when following a framework:
  -> short opener - medium paragrapph - checklist

#CTAs
- Ad them to ads (even when using images)
- Square images outperform rectangular ad versions
- saves time - works everywhere, identical creative

#Social proof
- Test your ads, find the hero ad and send it to your friends to comment and ads tons of positive social proof - long-lasting social proof
