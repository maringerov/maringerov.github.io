If you want to change the attitude of others, change your first.

Case in point:

- A man goes on to the bus without showing his ticket, not communicating to the driver. He gets an aggressive response from the annoyed driver.

- A man goes on the bus to ask for directions (unrelated to the journey), seemingly confused, and politely thanks the driver. The driver responds politely back.

If everyone starts from a positive place, adjusting their attitude towards positivity and common decency, [standards](https://maringerov.com/texts/values-standards/) improve for everyone.
